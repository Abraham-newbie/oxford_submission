This repository contains the submission for the task for the Oxford RA Application:

```
1-2 pager analyzing learning-adjusted years of schooling in Africa relative to other regions with key insights and takeaways. 

```

I also developed a simple RShiny app as an extension to the task, which allows you to visualize Learning outcomes such as LAYS and EYS. The shiny app uses the HLO Database (Harmonized Learning Outcomes (HLO) Database
Measuring Human Capital) and World Bank Human Capital Project Data. You can find the app [here](https://econ-newbie.shinyapps.io/rshinyapp/).

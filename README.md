This repository contains the submission for the following task:

```
1-2 pager analyzing learning-adjusted years of schooling in Africa relative to other regions with key insights and takeaways. 

```
## [1-2 Pager](https://github.com/Abraham-newbie/oxford_submission/blob/main/RA_Oxford_Submission.pdf)

The submission is titled **RA_Oxford_Submission**. I briefly study the African context using learning-adjusted years of schooling as a key metric in evaluating between-country differences and in comparison to other regions. I also summarize common threads in previous literature as well as challenges and solutions for improving learning in Africa. The appendix contains additional plots and visualizations.



## [RShiny App](https://econ-newbie.shinyapps.io/rshinyapp/)

I also developed a simple RShiny app as an extension to the task, which allows you to visualize Learning outcomes such as LAYS, EYS and HLO. You can find the app [here](https://econ-newbie.shinyapps.io/rshinyapp/).

The shiny app uses the Harmonized Learning Outcomes Database and World Bank Human Capital Project Data to provide simple interactive visualizations.



## Code and Data
The code and data are organized in the repository in their respective folders.

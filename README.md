RA Task Oxford | [Abraham Raju](https://github.com/Abraham-newbie)

This repository contains the submission for the task for the Oxford RA Application:

```
1-2 pager analyzing learning-adjusted years of schooling in Africa relative to other regions with key insights and takeaways. 

```
## 1-2 Pager

The summary is titled 'RA_Oxford_Submission'.

## RShiny App

I also developed a simple RShiny app as an extension to the task, which allows you to visualize Learning outcomes such as LAYS and EYS. You can find the app [here](https://econ-newbie.shinyapps.io/rshinyapp/).

The shiny app uses the Harmonized Learning Outcomes Database and World Bank Human Capital Project Data to provide simple interactive visualizations.



## Code and Data
The code and data are organized in the repository accordingly in their respective folders.

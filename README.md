RA Task Oxford | [Abraham Raju](https://github.com/Abraham-newbie)

This repository contains the submission for the task for the Oxford RA Application:

```
1-2 pager analyzing learning-adjusted years of schooling in Africa relative to other regions with key insights and takeaways. 

```
## 1-2 Pager

The summary is titled 'RA_Oxford_Submission'. I briefly study the African context using learning-adjusted years of schooling as a key metric, between-country differences and in comparison to other regions. The brief 
also evaluates the common direction in previous literature on the topic and summarizes challenges and solutions for improving learning in Africa.



## RShiny App

I also developed a simple RShiny app as an extension to the task, which allows you to visualize Learning outcomes such as LAYS, EYS and HLO. You can find the app [here](https://econ-newbie.shinyapps.io/rshinyapp/).

The shiny app uses the Harmonized Learning Outcomes Database and World Bank Human Capital Project Data to provide simple interactive visualizations.



## Code and Data
The code and data are organized in the repository in their respective folders.
